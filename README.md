# RPNCalc
A Reverse Polish Notation Calculator utilizing a Stack data structure.


A Reverse Polish Notation Calculator that is able to perform computations quickly because of the Stack data structure. This form of calculator does not need to have parenthesis in its syntax for it to work properly. The calculator can hold several operands at a time on the stack instead of only two operands like most regular calculators. This RPN Calculator uses three classes. the Driver class "drives" the calculator program, the RPNCalc class holds the operations necessary for the calculator to function, and the StackDemo class initializes the Stack for the program. This RPN calculator program utilizes a constructor to link the classes.
